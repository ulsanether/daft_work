This example pack is used specifically for the "Pullman SPAC40.json" shoe profile.

These DXF files are in Polyline format so they are using lots of little lines instead of splines to define their profile. If you need to convert then use the free Inkscape software and follow the following tutorial : http://repraprip.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/inkscape-to-openscad-dxf-tutorial.html

Make sure each curve is fully closed.

If the filename follows the format xxxxxx-20.dxf or xxxxxx-15.5.dxf where xxxxxx can be anything appropriate then the suffix value after the "-" will become the density of the zone, however this can be edited after loading.

Load the .DXF files on Tab 4 and position using the rotate/translate manipulator icons (top right) like you would a foot scan.
